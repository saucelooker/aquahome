# aquahome_app

This application works together with esp32 over wifi network. It is used to control light, temperature and oxygen saturation in the home aquarium. At the moment there is only local management, remote management is in the plans. The project for programming esp32 has already been tested, but is still in the process of being finalized. In the future, it will be uploaded to github along with the PCB project.

The application uses smart config to connect esp32, has light and dark themes and 2 language localizations.
